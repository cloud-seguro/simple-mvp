# Security Implementation: Client-Level Encryption

This document explains the security measures implemented in our application, particularly focusing on client-level encryption for passwords.

## Password Security Implementation

### Overview

We've implemented client-level encryption for passwords to ensure that:

1. Passwords are never transmitted in plain text over the network
2. Even with HTTPS, passwords get an additional layer of protection
3. Password security is enforced at multiple layers

### How It Works

#### Client-Side Password Encryption

- Before any password is sent to the server (including Supabase Auth), it's encrypted locally in the browser using SHA-256
- We use the `crypto-js` library to perform this encryption
- The password is encrypted in transit to prevent it from being visible in network requests

#### Implementation Details

1. **Password Utils**: A utility function `encryptPasswordForTransport()` encrypts passwords using SHA-256
2. **Secure Supabase Client**: A custom Supabase client wraps all authentication methods to automatically encrypt passwords
3. **Auth Provider**: Uses the secure client throughout the application

#### Security Layers

1. **Client-Level Encryption**: Passwords are encrypted in the browser before transmission
2. **HTTPS Transport**: All communication happens over encrypted connections
3. **Server-Side Hashing**: Supabase securely hashes passwords on the server with bcrypt
4. **Password Strength Requirements**: Enforced at the application level

### Code Patterns

#### Password Encryption Utility

```typescript
export const encryptPasswordForTransport = (password: string): string => {
  // Use SHA-256 for a one-way hash of the password
  return SHA256(password).toString();
};
```

#### Secure Supabase Client

We've implemented a middleware pattern that intercepts all authentication calls and automatically encrypts passwords:

```typescript
export const createSecureSupabaseClient = () => {
  const supabase = createClientComponentClient();

  // Intercept authentication methods
  const originalSignIn = supabase.auth.signInWithPassword;
  supabase.auth.signInWithPassword = async ({ email, password, ...rest }) => {
    // Encrypt password before sending
    const encryptedPassword = encryptPasswordForTransport(password);

    // Call original method with encrypted password
    return originalSignIn.call(supabase.auth, {
      email,
      password: encryptedPassword,
      ...rest,
    });
  };

  // Similar pattern for signUp
  // ...

  return supabase;
};
```

## Best Practices

1. **Never log passwords** in any form, even encrypted ones
2. **Don't store passwords** in local storage or cookies
3. **Use proper cryptographic libraries** for encryption
4. **Regularly update** cryptographic dependencies
5. **Implement strong password requirements** at the application level

## Additional Security Measures

- Password strength indicators
- Account lockouts after failed attempts
- Multi-factor authentication (if implemented)
- Session timeout policies

## Notes on SHA-256 vs. bcrypt

It's important to note that we're using SHA-256 for _transport encryption only_, not for password storage.

- Supabase uses bcrypt (a slow, salted hashing algorithm) for password storage
- SHA-256 provides a secure one-way transformation suitable for transport security
- This implementation provides defense-in-depth (multiple layers of security)
